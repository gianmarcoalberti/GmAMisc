# GmAMisc (Gianmarco Alberti Miscellaneous)
vers 0.4.1

`GmAMisc` is a collection of functions that I have built in different points in time. The functions' aim spans from univariate outlier detection, to permutation t test, permutation chi-square test, calculation of Brainerd-Robinson similarity coefficient, validation of logistic regression models, and more. 

The package comes with some toy datasets:

`assemblage`: distribution of 7 archaeological objects across 9 assemblages.

`log_regr_data`: admission to graduate school.

`phases`: posterior probabilities for the chronological relation of the Starting and Ending boundaries of two Bayesian independent 14C phases.

`radioc_data`: posterior probabilities for the Starting and Ending boundaries of two 14C phases.

## List of implemented functions
`aucadj()`: function for optimism-adjusted AUC (Logistic Regression internal validation). The function allows to calculate the AUC of a (binary) Logistic Regression model, adjusted for optimism. The function performs an internal validation of a model via a bootstrap procedure (devised by Harrell and colleagues), which enables to estimate the degree of optimism of a fitted model and the extent to which the model will be able to generalize outside the training dataset.
The returned boxplots represent:
* the distribution of the AUC value in the bootstrap sample (auc.boot), which represents "an estimation of the apparent performance" (according to the aforementioned reference);
* the distribution of the AUC value deriving from the model fitted to the bootstrap samples and evaluated on the original sample (auc.orig), which represents the model performance on independent data.

At the bottom of the chart, the apparent AUC (i.e., the value deriving from the model fitted to the original dataset) and the AUC adjusted for optimism are reported.

<br>

`BRsim()`: function for Brainerd-Robinson simiarity coefficient. The function allows to calculate the Brainerd-Robinson similarity coefficient, taking as input a cross-tabulation (dataframe).
The function will return:
* a) a correlation matrix in tabular form;
* b) a heat-map representing, in a graphical form, the aforementioned correlation matrix.
In the heat-map (which is built using the 'corrplot' package), the size and the color of the squares are proportional to the Brainerd-Robinson coefficients, which are also reported by numbers.

In order to "penalize" BR similarity coefficient(s) arising from assemblages with unshared categories, the function does what follows: it divides the BR coefficient(s) by the number of unshared categories plus 0.5. The latter addition is simply a means to be still able to penalize coefficient(s) arising from assemblages having just one unshared category. Also note that joint absences will have no weight on the penalization of the coefficient(s). In case of assemblages sharing all their categories, the corrected coefficient(s) turns out to be equal to the uncorrected one.

<br>

`chiperm()`: function for permutation-based chi-square test of independence. The function performs the chi-square test of independence on the basis of permuted tables, whose number is selected by user. For the rationale of this approach, see for instance the nice description provided by Beh E.J., Lombardo R. 2014, *Correspondence Analysis: Theory, Practice and New Strategies*, Chichester, Wiley, pages 62-64.
The function produces:
* (1) a chart that displays the permuted distribution of the chi square statistic based on B permuted tables. The selected number of permuted tables, the observed chi square, the 95th percentile of the permuted distribution, and the associated p value are reported at the bottom of the chart; 
* (2) a chart that displays the bootstrap distribution of Cramer's V coefficient, based on a number of bootstrap replicates which is equal to the value of the function's parameter B; 
* (3) a chart that the Pearson's Standardized Residuals: a colour scale allows to easily understand which residual is smaller (BLUE) or larger (RED) than expected under the hypothesis of independence. Should the user want to only display residuals larger than a given threshold, it suffices to set the filter parameter to TRUE, and to specify the desidered threshold by means of the thresh parameter, which is set at 1.96 by default.

<br>

`kwPlot()`: function for visually displaying Kruskal-Wallis test's results. The function allows to perform Kruskal-Wallis test, and to display the test's results in a plot along with boxplots. The boxplots display the distribution of the values of the two samples, and jittered points represent the individual observations. At the bottom of the chart, the test statistics (H) is reported, along with the degrees of freedom and the associated p value. Setting the parameter 'posthoc' to TRUE, the Dunn's test is performed (with Bonferroni adjustment by default): a dot chart is returned, as well as a list of p-values (2-sided). In the dot chart, a RED line indicates the 0.05 threshold. The groups compared on a pairwise basis are indicated on the left-hand side of the chart.

<br>

`logregr()`: function easy binary Logistic Regression and model diagnostics. The function allows to make it easy to perform binary Logistic Regression, and to graphically display the estimated coefficients and odds ratios. It also allows to visually check model's diagnostics such as outliers, leverage, and Cook's distance. The function may take a while (just matter of few seconds) to completed all the operations, and will eventually return the following charts:
* (1) Estimated coefficients, along with each coefficient's confidence interval; a reference line is set to 0. Each bar is given a color according to the associated p-value, and the key to the color scale is reported in the chart's legend.
* (2) Odds ratios and their confidence intervals.
* (3) A chart that is helpful in visually gauging the discriminatory power of the model: the predicted probability (x axis) are plotted against the dependent variable (y axis). If the model proves to have a high discriminatory power, the two stripes of points will tend to be well separated, i.e. the positive outcome of the dependent variable (points with color corresponding to 1) would tend to cluster around high values of the predicted probability, while the opposite will hold true for the negative outcome of the dependent variable (points with color corresponding to 0). In this case, the AUC (which is reported at the bottom of the chart) points to a low discriminatory power.
* (4) Model's standardized (Pearson's) residuals against the predicted probability; the size of the points is proportional to the Cook's distance, and problematic points are flagged by a label reporting their observation number if the following two conditions happen: residual value larger than 3 (in terms of absolute value) AND Cook's distance larger than 1. Recall that an observation is an outlier if it has a response value that is very different from the predicted value based on the model. But, being an outlier doesn't automatically imply that that observation has a negative effect on the model; for this reason, it is good to also check for the Cook's distance, which quantifies how influential is an observation on the model's estimates. Cook's distance should not be larger than 1.
* (5) Predicted probability plotted against the leverage value; dots represent observations, and their size is proportional to their leverage value, and their color is coded according to whether or not the leverage is above (lever. not ok) or below (lever. ok) the critical threshold. The latter is represented by a grey reference line, and is also reported at the bottom of the chart itself. An observation has high leverage if it has a particularly unusual combination of predictor values. Observations with high leverage are flagged with their observation number, making it easy to spot them within the dataset. Remember that values with high leverage and/or with high residual may be potential influencial points and may potentially negatively impact the regression. We will return on this when examining the following two plots. As for the leverage threshold, it is set at `3*(k+1)/N` (following Pituch-Stevens, *Applied Multivariate Statistics for the Social Science. Analyses with SAS and IBM's SPSS*, Routledge: New York 2016), where k is the number of predictors and N is the sample size.
* (6) Predicted probability against the Cook's distance.
* (7) Standardized (Pearson's) residuals against the leverage; points representing observations with positive or negative outcome of the dependent variable are given different colors. Further, points' size is proportional to the Cook's distance. Leverage threshold is indicated by a grey reference line, and the threshold value is also reported at the bottom of the chart. Observations are flagged with their observation number if their residual is larger than 3 (in terms of absolute value) OR if leverage is larger than the critical threshold OR if Cook's distance is larger than 1. This allows to easily check which observation turns out to be an outlier or a high-leverage data point or an influential point, or a combination of the three.
* (8) Chart that is almost the same as (7) except for the way in which observations are flagged. In fact, they are flagged if the residual is larger than 3 (again, in terms of absolute value) OR if the leverage is higher than the critical threshold AND if a Cook's distance larger than 1 plainly declares them as having a high influence on the model's estimates. Since an observation may be either an outlier or a high-leverage data point, or both, and yet not being influential, the chart allows to spot observations that have an undue influence on our model, regardless of them being either outliers or high-leverage data points, or both.
* (9) Observation numbers are plotted against the standardized (Pearson's) residuals, the leverage, and the Cook's distance. Points are labelled according to the rationales explained in the preceding points. By the way, the rationale is also explained at the bottom of each plots.

The function also returns a list storing two objects: one is named 'formula' and stores the formula used for the logistic regression; the other contains the model's results.

<br>

`modelvalid()`: function for binary Logistic Regression internal validation. The function allows to perform internal validation of a binary Logistic Regression model, implementing part of the procedure described in Arboretti Giancristofaro R, Salmaso L. *Model performance analysis and model validation in logistic regression*. Statistica 2003(63): 375–396.
The procedure consists of the following steps:
* (1) the whole dataset is split into two random parts, a fitting (75 percent) and a validation (25 percent) portion;
* (2) the model is fitted on the fitting portion (i.e., its coefficients are computed considering only the observations in that portion) and its performance is evaluated on both the fitting and the validation portion, using AUC as performance measure;
* (3) steps 1-2 are repeated B times, eventually getting a fitting and validation distribution of the AUC values. The former provides an estimate of the performance of the model in the population of all the theoretical training samples; the latter represents an estimate of the model’s performance on new and independent data.

The function returns two boxplots that represent the training and the testing (i.e., validation) distribution of the AUC value across the 1000 iterations. For an example of the interpretation of the chart, see the aforementioned article, especially page 390-91.

<br>

`monthlyWind()`: function that allows to download wind data from NOAA/NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) Atmospheric Model colection, creating monthly averages. The extent of the study area can be specified either by entering the geographic coordinates, or on the basis of an input raster dataset representing the study area itself (for instance, a Digital Elevation Model). 

The function saves two .geotiff files in the computer's working directory, one representing the wind speed, the other the wind direction. In both cases, the values are the average of the wind speed and direction values in the study area across the days of the selected month, in the selected year. A plot is also returned in the R console.
The function returns a list containing the following data:\cr
* `$windMonth`: stores the U and V components for each output grid cell (spatial resolution 0.5 degrees=50 Km);
* `$windMonthFit`: stores the wind speed and direction for each output grid cell.

The function builds upon the `wind.dl()` function from Javier Fernández-López's package `rWind`. The help provided by Dr Fernández-López in creating an earlier version of the `monthlyWind()` function is gratefully acknowledged.

<br>

`mwPlot()`: function for visually displaying Mann-Whitney test's results. The function allows to perform Mann-Whitney test, and to display the test's results in a plot along with two boxplots. For information about the test, and on what it is actually testing, see for instance the interesting article by R M Conroy, *What hypotheses do "nonparametric" two-group tests actually test?*, in The Stata Journal 12 (2012): 1-9. The returned boxplots display the distribution of the values of the two samples, and jittered points represent the individual observations. At the bottom of the chart, a subtitle arranged on three lines reports relevant statistics:
* test statistic (namely, U) and the associated z and p value;
* Probability of Superiority value (which can be interpreted as an effect-size measure);
* another measure of effect size, namely r, whose thresholds are indicated in the last line of the plot's subtitle.

The function may also return a density plot (coupled with a rug plot at the botton of the same chart) that displays the distribution of the pairwise differences between the values of the two samples being compared. The median of this distribution (which is represented by a blue reference line in the same chart) corresponds to the Hodges-Lehmann estimator.

<br>

`outlier`: function for univariate outliers detection. The function allows to perform univariate outliers detection using three different methods. These methods are those described in: Wilcox R R, *Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods: Substantially Improving Power and Accuracy*, Springer 2010 (2nd edition), pages 31-35.
Two of the three methods are robust, and are therefore less prone to the masking effect.
* (1) With the mean-based method, an observation is considered outlier if the absolute difference between that observation and the sample mean is more than 2 Standard Deviations away (in either direction) from the mean. In the plot returned by the function, the central reference line is indicating the mean value, while the other two are set at `mean-2*SD and mean+2*SD`.
* (2) The median-based method considers an observation as being outlier if the absolute difference between the observation and the sample median is larger than the Median Absolute Deviation divided by 0.6745. In this case, the central reference line is set at the median, while the other two are set at `median-2*MAD/0.6745` and `median+2*MAD/0.6745`.
* (3) The boxplot-based method considers an observation as being an outlier if it is either smaller than the 1st Quartile minus 1.5 times the InterQuartile Range, or larger than the 3rd Quartile minus 1.5 times the InterQuartile Range. In the plot, the central reference line is set at the median, while the other two are set at `1Q-1.5*IQR` and `3Q+1.5*IQR`.

The function also returns a list containing information about the choosen method, the mid-point, lower and upper boundaries where non-outlying observations are expected to fall, total number of outlying observations, and a dataframe listing the observations and indicating which is considered outlier. In the charts, the outlying observations are flagged with their ID number.

<br>

`perm.t.test()`: function for permutation-based t-test. The function allows to perform a permutation-based t-test to compare two independent groups. The test's results are graphically displayed within the returned chart. A permutation t-test proves useful when the assumption of 'regular' t-test are not met. In particular, when the two groups being compared show a very skewed distribution, and when the sample sizes are very unbalanced.
*"The permutation test is useful even if we plan to use the two-sample t test. Rather than relying on Normal quantile plots of the two samples and the central limit theorem, we can directly check the Normality of the sampling distribution by looking at the permutation distribution. Permutation tests provide a “gold standard” for assessing two-sample t tests. If the two P-values differ considerably, it usually indicates that the conditions for the two-sample t don’t hold for these data. Because permutation tests give accurate P-values even when the sampling distribution is skewed, they are often used when accuracy is very important."* (Moore, McCabe, Craig, *Introduction to the Practice of Statistics*, New York: W. H. Freeman and Company, 2009).
The chart returned by the function diplays the distribution of the permuted mean difference between the two samples; a dashed line indicates the observed mean difference. A rug plot at the bottom of the density curve indicates the individual permuted mean differences. Under the chart, a number of information are displayed. In particular, the observed mean difference, the number of permutations used, and the permuted p-value are reported. In the last row, the result of the regular t-test (both assuming and not assuming equal variances) is reported to allow users to compare the outcome of these different versions of the test.

<br>

`plotJenks()`: function for plotting univariate classification using Jenks' natural break method. The function allows to break a dataset down into a user-defined number of breaks and to nicely plot the results, adding a number of other relevant information. Implementing the Jenks' natural breaks method, it allows to find the best arrangement of values into different classes.
The function produces a chart in which the values of the input variable are arranged on the x-axis in ascending order, while the index of the individual observations is reported on the y-axis. Vertical dotted red lines correspond to the optimal break-points which best divide the input variable into the selected classes. The break-points (and their values) are reported in the upper part of the chart, onto the corresponding break lines. Also, the chart's subtitle reports the Goodness of Fit value relative to the selected partition, and the partition which correspond to the maximum GoF value.
The function also returns a list containing the following:
* `$info`: information about whether or not the method created non-unique breaks;
* `$classif`: created classes and number of observations falling in each class;
* `$classif$brks`: classes' break-points;
* `$breaks$max.GoF`: number of classes at which the maximum GoF is achieved;
* `$class.data`: dataframe storing the values and the class in which each value actually falls into.

<br>

`ppdPlot()`: function for plotting Posterior Probability Densities for Bayesian modeled 14C dates/parameters. The function allows plot Posterior Probability Densities with a nice outlook thanks to `ggplot2`. It takes as input a dataframe that must be organized as follows (it is rather easy to do that once the data have been exported from OxCal):
* calendar dates (first column to the left);
* posterior probabilities (second column);
* grouping variables (third column), which could contain the names of the events of interest (e.g., phase 1 start, phase 1 end, phase 2 start, phase 2 end, etc).

<br>

`prob.phases.relat()`: function to calculate the Posterior Probability for different chronological relations between two Bayesian radiocarbon phases. The function allows to calculate the posterior probability for different chronological relations between two phases defined via Bayesian radiocarbon modeling. For the results to make sense, the phases have to be defined as independent if one wishes to assess what is the posterior probability for different relative chronological relations between them.
The rationale for this approach is made clear in an article by Buck et al 1992 (https://doi.org/10.1016/0305-4403(92)90025-X), and it runs as follows: *if we do not make any assumption about the relationship between the phases, can we test how likely they are to be in any given order*?

The function takes as input the table provided by the 'OxCal' program as result of the 'Order' query. Once the table as been saved from 'OxCal' in .csv format, you have to feed it in R. A .csv file can be imported into R using (for instance): `mydata <- read.table(file.choose(), header=TRUE, sep=",", dec=".", as.is=T)`
Make sure to insert the phases' parameters (i.e., the starting and ending boundaries of the two phases) in the OxCal's Order query in the following order: StartA, EndA, StartB, EndB. That is, first the start and end of your first phase, then the start and end of the second one. You can give any name to your phases, as long as the order is like the one described.

Given two phases A and B, the function allows to calculate the posterior probability for:
* A being within B
* B being within A
* A starting earlier but overlapping with B
* B starting earlier but overlapping with A
* A being entirely before B
* B being entirely before A
* sA being within B
* eA being within B
* sB being within A
* eB being within A
where 's' and 'e' refer to the starting and ending boundaries of a phase. 

The function will return a table and a dot plot.
Thanks are due to Dr. Andrew Millard (Durham University) for the help provided in working out the operations on probabilities.

<br>

`robustBAplot()`: function to plot a robust version of the Bland-Altman plot. It returns a chart based on robust (i.e. resistant to outlying values) measures of central tendency and variability: median and Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) (Wilcox R R. 2001. *Fundamentals of modern statistical methods: Substantially improving power and accuracy*. New York: Springer) instead of mean and standard deviation.
The x-axis displays the median of the two variables being compared, while the y-axis represents their difference. A solid horizontal line represents the bias, i.e. the median of the differences reported on the y-axis. Two dashed horizontal lines represent the region in which 95percent of the observations are expected to lie; they are set at the median plus or minus `z*(MAD/0.6745)`.
