#' R function to calculate the significance of the spatial relationship between two features (points-to-points, points-to-lines, points-to-polygons)
#'
#' The function allows to assess if there is a significant spatial association between two features.
#' For instance, users may want to assess if some locations tend to lie close to some features represented by polylines.
#' By the same token, users may want to know if there is a spatial association between the location of a given event and the location of another event. See the example provided further below (in the examples section), where the question to address is if there is a spatial association between springs and geological fault-lines; in other words: do springs tend to be located near the geological faults?\cr
#'
#' Given a from-feature (event for which we want to estimate the spatial association with the to-feature) and a to-feature (event in relation to which we want to estimate the spatial association for the from-feature), the assessment is performed by means of a randomized procedure:\cr
#'
#' -keeping fixed the location of the to-feature, random from-features are drawn B times (the number of randomized from-features is equal to the number of observed from-features);\cr
#' -for each draw, the average minimum distance to the to-features is calculated; if the to-feature is made up of polygons, the from-features falling within a polygon will have a distance of 0;\cr
#' -a distribution of average minimum distances is thus obtained;\cr
#' -the significance (let's call it p) of the observed average minimum distance is calculated by counting how many randomized average minimum distances are equal or smaller than the observed one, and dividing the count by B. The probability that the observed average minimum distance is equal or larger than the randomized average minimum distance is equal to 1-p.\cr
#'
#' The from-feature must be a point feature, whilst the to-feature can be a point or a polyline or a polygon feature. The rationale of the procedure is that, if there indeed is a spatial association between the two features, the from-feature should be on average closer to the to-feature than randomly generated from-features.
#' If the study plot shapefile is not provided, the random locations are drawn within a bounding polygon based on the union the convex hulls of the from- and of the to-feature.\cr
#'
#' The function produces a plot representing: the distribution of randomized average minimum distances; a reference line indicating the observed average minimum distance; a black dot representing the average of the randomized minimum distances. P-values are reported at the bottom of the plot.\cr
#'
#' A list is also returned, containing what follows:\cr
#' -$from.feat.min.dist: distance of each entity of the from-feature to the nearest entity of the to-feature;\cr
#' -$avrg.obs.min.dist: observed average minimum distance;\cr
#' -$avrg.rnd.min.dist: randomized average minimum distance;\cr
#' -$Prob. of obs. aver. min. dist. <= random. aver. min. dist;\cr
#' -$Prob. of obs. aver. min. dist. >= random. aver. min. dist.
#' @param from.feat: feature (of point type) whose spatial association with the to-feature has to be assessed.
#' @param to.feat: feature (point, polyline, or polygon type) in relation to which the spatial association of the from-feature has to be assessed.
#' @param studyplot: shapefile (of polygon type) representing the study area; if not provided, the study area is internally worked out as the bounding polygon based on the union the convex hulls of the from- and of the to-feature.
#' @param buffer: add a buffer to the convex hull of the study area (0 by default); the unit depends upon the units of the input data.
#' @param B: number of randomizations to be used (1000 by default).
#' @param addmap: TRUE (default) or FALSE if the user wants or does not want a map of the study area and of the from- and to-feature to be also displayed.
