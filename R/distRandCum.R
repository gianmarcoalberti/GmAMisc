#' R function to test the significance of the spatial relationship between two features in terms of the cumulative distribution of minimum distances
#'
#' The function allows to assess if there is a significant spatial association between a point pattern and the features of another pattern.
#' For instance, users may want to assess if the features of a point pattern tend to lie close to some features represented by polylines.\cr
#'
#' Given a from-feature (event for which we want to estimate the spatial association with the to-feature) and a to-feature
#' (event in relation to which we want to estimate the spatial association for the from-feature), the assessment is performed by means of q randomized procedure:\cr
#'
#' -keeping fixed the location of the to-feature, random from-features are drawn B times (the number of randomized from-features is equal to the number of observed from-features);\cr
#' -for each draw, the minimum distance to the to-features is calculated; if the to-feature is made up of polygons, the from-features falling within a polygon will have a distance of 0;\cr
#' -a cumulative distribution of random minimum distances is thus obtained;\cr
#' -the cumulative random minimum distances are used to work out a 95percent confidence envelope that allows to assess the statistical significance of the
#' cumulative distribution of the observed minimum distances.\cr
#'
#' The from-feature must be a point feature, whilst the to-feature can be a point or a polyline or a polygon feature.\cr
#'
#' The rationale of the procedure is that, if there indeed is a spatial association between the two features, the from-feature should be closer to the to-feature than randomly generated from-features.
#' If the studyplot shapefile is not provided, the random locations are drawn within a bounding polygon based on the union the convex hulls of the from- and of the to-feature.\cr
#'
#' If both the from-feature and the to-feature are of point type (SpatialPointsDataFrame class), the user may opt for the randomized procedure described above (parameter 'type' set to 'rand'),
#' or for a permutation-based procedure (parameter 'type' set to 'perm'). Unlike the procedure described above, whereby random points are drawn within the study area, the permutation-based routine
#' builds a cumulative distribution of minimum distances keeping the points location unchanged and randomly assigning the points to either of the two patterns.
#' The re-assigment is performed B times (200 by default) and each time the minimum distance is calculated.\cr
#'
#' The function produces a cumulative distribution chart in which the distribution of the observed minimum distances is represented by a black line,
#' and the 95percent confidence envelope is represented in grey. The number of iteration used and the type of analysis
#' (whether randomization-based or permutation-based) are reported in the chart's title.\cr
#'
#' @param from.feat: feature (of point type; SpatialPointsDataFrame class) whose spatial association with the to-feature has to be assessed.
#' @param to.feat: feature (point, polyline, or polygon type; SpatialPointsDataFrame, SpatialLinesDataFrame, SpatialPolygonsDataFrame class) in relation to which the spatial association of the from-feature has to be assessed.
#' @param studyplot: feature (of polygon type; SpatialPolygonsDataFrame class) representing the study area; if not provided, the study area is internally worked out as the bounding polygon based on the union the convex hulls of the from- and of the to-feature.
#' @param buffer: add a buffer to the convex hull of the study area (0 by default); the unit depends upon the units of the input data.
#' @param B: number of randomizations to be used (200 by default).
#' @param type: by default is set to "rand", which performs the randomization-based analysis; if both the from.feature and the to.feature dataset are of
#' point type, setting the parameter to "perm" allows to opt for the permutation-based approach.
