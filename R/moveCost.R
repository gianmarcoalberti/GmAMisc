#' R function for calculating accumulated cost of movement across the terrain and least-cost paths from an origin.
#'
#' The function provides the facility to calculate the accumulated cost of movement around a starting location and to optionally calculate least-cost paths toward
#' one or multiple destinations. The function implements different cost estimations directly or inderectly related to human movement across the landscape.
#' The function takes as input a Digital Terrain Model (RasterLayer class) and a point feature (SpatialPointsDataFrame class), the latter representing
#' the starting location, i.e. the location from which the accumulated cost is calculated. \cr
#'
#' If the parameter 'destin' is fed with a datset representing destination location(s) (SpatialPointsDataFrame class), the function will also calculate
#' least-cost path(s) plotted on the input DTM; the length of each path will be saved under the variable 'length' stored in the 'LCPs' dataset (SpatialLines class) returned by the function.
#' The red dot(s) representing the destination location(s) will be labelled with numeric values representing
#' cost value at the location(s). The cost value will be also appended to the updated destination dataset returned by the function and
#' storing a new variable named 'cost'.\cr
#'
#' The function builds on functions out of the 'gdistance' package, and by default uses a 16-directions movement in calculating the accumulated cost-surface.
#' The number of movements can be set by the user via the 'moves' parameter. As noted in Nakoinz-Knitter (2016). "Modelling Human Behaviour in Landscapes". New York: Springer, p. 183,
#' "gdistance works with conductivity rather than the more usual approach using costs, we need inverse cost functions". For this reason, in this function the cost is calculated
#' using the inverse of the published cost functions.\cr
#'
#' The following cost functions are implemented:\cr
#'
#' \strong{Tobler's hiking function (on-path)}: reshaped as follows \cr
#'
#' \eqn{((6 * exp(3.5 * abs(slope + 0.05))) * 0.278)^-1}\cr
#'
#' if we use speed, the final accumulated values will be 1/travel time (according to the 'gdistance' help documentation; see page 16 of this PDF: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gdistance/vignettes/gdistance1.pdf);
#' therefore, we use the reciprocal of speed to eventually get travel time/1. The Tobler's equation is multiplied by 0.278 (which is the ratio between 1000 -meters in 1 km- and 3600 -seconds in 1 hour-) to turn KmH into m/s,
#' and then reciprocated to turn m/s to s/m; before being reciprocating, we drop the minus before the 3.5. The same applies to the other Tobler's function-related
#' equations listed below.\cr
#'
#'
#' \strong{Tobler's hiking function (off-path)}:\cr
#'
#' \eqn{(((6 * exp(3.5 * abs(slope + 0.05))) * 1.666667) * 0.278)^-1}\cr
#'
#' as per Tobler's indication, the off-path walking speed is reduced by 0.6; we use the reciprocal (1.666667) in our case since we are dealing with pace instead of speed.\cr

#'
#' \eqn{((4.8 * exp(5.3 * abs((slope[adj] * 0.7) + 0.03))) * 0.278)^-1}\cr

#' Geografisk Tidsskrift-Danish Journal of Geography, 117:1, 53-62, DOI: 10.1080/00167223.2017.1316212.\cr

#' \eqn{(tan((atan(abs(slope) * 57.29578) * 0.0174532925)  / tan(1 * 0.0174532925)))^-1}\cr
#'
#' slope-based cost function expressing change in potential energy expenditure; in the above formula, atan(abs(slope)) * 57.29578) turns rise-over-run to degrees; multiplying by 0.0174532925 turns degrees to radians before calculating the tangent; the same applies to the degrees in the denominator. \cr

#' When using the Tobler-related cost functions, the time unit can be selected by the user setting the 'time' parameter to 'h' (hour) or to 'm' (minutes).\cr
#'
#' In general, the user can also select which type of visualization the function has to produce; this is achieved setting the 'outp' parameter to either 'r' (=raster)
#' or to 'c' (=contours). The former will produce a raster image with a colour scale and contour lines representing the accumulated cost surface; the latter parameter will only
#' produce contour lines.\cr
#'
#' The contour lines' interval is set using the parameter 'breaks'; is not value is passed to the parameter, the interval will be set by default to
#' 1/10 of the range of values of the accumulated cost surface.\cr
#'
#' The function returns a list storing:\cr
#' -$accumulated.cost.raster: raster representing the accumualted cost (RasterLayer class);\cr
#' -$isolines: contour lines derived from the accumulated cost surface (SpatialLinesDataFrame class);\cr
#' -$LCPs: estimated least-cost paths (SpatialLines class);\cr
